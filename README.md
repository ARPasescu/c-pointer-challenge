# C Pointer Challenge - Music Playlist

A coding challenge I completed on 1 November 2022 for my graduation internship application.

The solution features the implementation of the music playlist linked list manipulation methods stored as a separate API library, and includes extras such as an options menu for easy interfacing and persistent data storage for the playlist contents.
